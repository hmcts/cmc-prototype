        Jan Clark's claim
      </h1>

      <p>Jan Clark has made a money claim against you.</p>

       <p class="panel panel-border-wide">You have until <strong class="bold">7 June</strong> to respond to this
        claim.</p>

      <p class="heading-medium">Claim amount: <span class="bold">£1,500</span></p>


      <p class="heading-medium">Reason for claim</p>

      <p>Mary Richards and I signed a contract for building works on my roof. The work on the roof was completed but
        there was a problem with one section. I asked Mary Richards to get the problem fixed, but didn't get a
        reply.</p> <p>I'll have to get another builder to rectify the problem which will cost me £1,500.</P> <p>Therefore, I'm making a money
        claim for £1,500 to compensate for the extra money I'm going to need to spend.</p>

          <p>You might have to pay more or get a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt">County

        <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">
          <p><span class="bold">If you accept the claim is fair</span> you can respond to say that you agree to pay the money. If you can't
            afford to pay it all at once you can make a suggestion, such as a repayment plan, for them to consider.</p>
          <p><span class="bold">If you don't accept you owe the amount of money claimed</span> you'll be asked to submit your defence and might have to go to a hearing. You'll also have the option to <span class="bold">make a 'without prejudice' suggestion</span> to try to settle the claim. This means the other side can’t mention that you made them an offer if they choose to reject it and you do end up at a hearing.</p>
          <p><span class="bold">If you believe the claimant owes you money</span> you can make a claim against them (‘counterclaim’). You might have to pay a <a class="external" rel="external" href="https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money/court-fees"
                     target="_blank">court fee</a>.</p>

          <p>Yes, you can contact Jan Clark yourself and pay the money. Ask them to let the court
