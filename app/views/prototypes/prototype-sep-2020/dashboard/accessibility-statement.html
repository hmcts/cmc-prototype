        Accessibility statement for the Online Civil Money Claims service
      </h1>

      <p>
        This service allows you to make a money claim against an individual or an organisation for £10,000 or less.

      </p>
      <p>
        This website is run by HM Courts and Tribunals Services (HMCTS). We want as many people as possible to be able to use it, so we’ve designed it to be accessible.
        For example, you should be able to:
      </p>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

        <p>Images within some emails cannot be read by screen readers.
          This fails WCAG 2.1A [1.1.1] success criterion (Non-text Content). We plan to fix this by October 2020.
        </p>

        <p>Links within some emails cannot be read by screen readers.
          This fails WCAG 2.1A [2.4.4] success criterion (Link Purpose in Context). We plan to fix this by October 2020.
        </p>

        <p>
          Screen reader users were unable to identify the state of each task when navigating out of context in some of the pages.

        </p>


        <p>
          Error suggestions do not accurately describe the validation error that occurs and do not conform with GOV.UK Design System guidelines in one of the pages.

          This fails WCAG 2.1AA [3.3.3] success criterion (Error Suggestion). We plan to fix this by October 2020.

      How we tested this website
    </h2>


    <p>This website was and is currently being internally tested for compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines V2.1 level A and level AA.</p>

    <p>We continually run automated accessibility testing as part of our development practices. This helps us to resolve issues before we launch new pages or features.</p>

    <p>This website was also tested by the Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) in January 2020 against WCAG 2.1 standards.</p>

    <a href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/" target="_blank">Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC)</a> -->

    <p>
      To give a more accurate review of the service the DAC team employed two differing testing processes:</p>


      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>a manual technical audit using automated tools</li>
        <li>a dedicated team of users with differing disabilities tested the service using a range of adaptive technologies </li>
      </ul>


      <p>The report combined technical auditing and feedback from users with accessibility needs.<p>






        <h2 class="heading-large">
          What we’re doing to improve accessibility

        </h2>

        <p>  We plan to fix identified issues according to the timescales shown for each area above.</p>
        <p>We will continue to test this website using accessibility software for any new features which are introduced. </p>
        <p>We also endeavour to fix any issues identified by our users or any new issues that we identify as part of our internal testing or external audits. </p>
