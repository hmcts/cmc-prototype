      <p>This claim is about building works.</p>
      <p>Mary Richards and I signed a contract for building works on my roof. The work on the roof was completed but
        there was a problem with one section. I asked Mary Richards to get the problem fixed, but didn't get a
      reply.</p> <p>I'll have to get another builder to rectify the problem which will cost me {% if data['mediation-pilot']=="on" %}
      £270
      {%else%}
      £1,430
      {% endif %}.</P> <p>Therefore, I'm making a money
      claim for {% if data['mediation-pilot']=="on" %}
      £300
      {%else%}
      £1,500
      {% endif %} to compensate for the money I'm going to need to spend on the roof and also the claim fee.</p>
