        Apply for a warrant of control
      </h1>

      <p>You should only apply for a warrant of control if you believe {{ partyName( 'defendant' ) }} has either:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>the amount you're trying to recover</li>
        <li>items that could be taken by a bailiff and sold at auction to raise that amount</li>
      </ul>

      <details>
        <summary><span class="summary">What bailiffs can and can't take</span></summary>
        <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">
          <p>Bailiffs can take luxury items, for example a TV or games console.</p>
          <p>They cannot take:</p>
          <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>things {{ partyName( 'defendant' ) }} needs to live, such as clothes, a cooker or a bed</li>
            <li>pets or guide dogs</li>
            <li>a phone or mobile phone</li>
            <li>work tools and equipment worth a total of less than £1,350</li>
            <li>medicine or medical equipment</li>
            <li>anything bought on finance, such as a car bought using hire purchase</li>
            <li>someone else's belongings, such as their partner's computer</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </details>

      <p>When the warrant has been issued, the court will phone {{ partyName( 'defendant' ) }} asking for payment.</p>

      <p>If {{ partyName( 'defendant' ) }} doesn't pay within 7 days, a bailiff will visit the address you gave within 15 days of the
        issue of the warrant. The bailiff usually visits up to 3 times.</p>
