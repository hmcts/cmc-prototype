      <p>When the warrant has been issued, a bailiff will contact Alex Richards. The bailiff usually sends a letter asking for payment. </p>
      <p>If Alex Richards doesn't pay within 7 days, the bailiff will visit the address you gave within 15 days of the issue of the warrant.</p>
      <p>If the defendant pays, the court will send you the money.</p>
