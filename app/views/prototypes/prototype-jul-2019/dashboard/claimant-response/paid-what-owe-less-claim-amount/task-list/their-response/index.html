      The defendant's response

      <p> Mary Richards said they paid you £{{ data['owe-amount'] or '1,430' }}. They said this is all they owe, not the amount you claimed.<p>

      <p>{{ now | date('add' , 3 , 'days') | date( 'subtract', 1, 'months') | date }}</p>

      <p class="heading-small">How they say they paid</p>
      <p>I posted a cheque to Jan Clark.</p>

      <p class="heading-small">Why they say they don't owe the amount you claimed</p>



<p>"The amount I was quoted for was £1,430. I'm not paying the £70 court fee as this should have been settled for the claim was issued."</p>
