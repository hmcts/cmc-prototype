          Try to resolve the dispute

          </h1>

          <p>Before you claim you should:</p>

            <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>talk to the person or organisation you want to claim against</li>
                <li>consider mediation</li>
            </ul>
          <h2 class="heading-medium">Talk to the person or organisation</h2>

          <p>Try to resolve the dispute by:</p>

          <ul class="list list-bullet">

              <li>telling them why you intend to claim against them</li>
              <li>suggesting a timetable with actions you want them to take
              </li>
              <li> explaining you'll claim against them if they don't follow your timetable
              </li>
          </uL>

          <h2 class="heading-medium">Consider mediation</h2>
          <p>Mediation is when an impartial person helps both sides to agree - it can be quicker and cheaper than making a claim.</p>


              <p>It can often be done on the phone. If you don't want to
              speak to the person you're claiming against, a mediator can speak to you both separately.</p>

              <h4 class="heading-small">Before making a claim</h3>

                  <p>If you intend to claim against an organisation, it may have a mediation service or complaints process you can use.</p>

                  <!-- <p>You can also <a target="_blank" href="http://civilmediation.justice.gov.uk/">use a paid mediation service</a> <span class="font-xsmall">(opens in a new window)</span>. -->

                  <h3 class="heading-small">After making a claim</h3>

                  <p>If the person or organisation disputes your claim you may be able to use the free Small Claims Mediation Service.</p>
