      <p>Your claim has been automatically registered for free telephone mediation.</p>
      <p>We'll contact you with a mediation appointment unless either:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>Mary Richards admits all of your claim and pays in full</li>
          <li>they don't admit the full claim, but they reject mediation</li>
