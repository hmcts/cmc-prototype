        You chose not to try free mediation
      </h1>

      <p>The claim will continue and you may have to go to a hearing.</p>



      <h3 class="heading-medium">Advantages of free mediation</h3>

      <p>Mediation is quicker than waiting for a court hearing and can avoid the possibility of court fees and a County Court Judgment made against you.</p>

<p>Mediation appointments last for one hour, led by a trained mediator from HM Courts and Tribunals Service. The mediator speaks to each side separately, you do not speak to the other party during mediation.</p>


               


      <!--<p>More than 60% of people who use our free mediation service settle on the day.*</p>

      <p>Opting out can mean:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>a long wait for the claim to be resolved</li>
        <li>a court hearing, which can last a whole day</li>
        <li>a County Court Judgment against you</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You'll only talk to the mediator on the phone, not to Jan Clark.</p>-->

      <h2 class="heading-medium">
      Will you change your decision and try free mediation?

      <p>If you choose not to try mediation this cannot be changed once your response is submitted.</p>
