        <p>You can apply to get the CCJ 'set aside'. You'll have to pay a court fee of £255. If you're on a low income you can get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-help-with-court-fees">help with fees.</a></p>

        <p>You'll need to show that you responded to the claim. You may need to go to a hearing.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">If your application is successful</h3>
        <p>Your CCJ will be removed from public records. The court will restart the claim.</p>

        <p>You can request the claimant refund your £255 fee.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">If your application is unsuccessful</h3>
        <p>You might have to pay the claimant's costs. For example their legal fees or travel costs if it goes to a hearing.</p>
        <p>The CCJ will stay on the register for 6 years.</p>
