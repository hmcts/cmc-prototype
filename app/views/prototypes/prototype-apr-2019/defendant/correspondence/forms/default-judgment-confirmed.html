 {% else %}
<p>The court orders you to pay the claimant £1,500, plus interest to the date of judgment.</p>
<p>You must pay the claimant the total of £1500 immediately.</p>

 {% endif %}

<h2>How to pay</h2>

<p>Contact the claimant if you need their payment details. Make sure you get receipts for any payments. </p>
<p>If you pay in full within one month, or you have already paid, you can ask the court to remove the judgment from the register. The judgment won't appear in credit agency searches, though some agencies may not update their records immediately. If you need proof that the judgment is cancelled you can pay £15 to get a certificate of cancellation.</p>
<p>If you pay in full in more than one month, you can ask the court to mark the judgment as satisfied. Any credit agency that checks the register will see you've paid the money, though some may not update their records immediately. The judgment will remain on the register for 6 years but it'll be marked as satisfied. If you need proof that the judgment is paid you can pay £15 to get a certificate of satisfaction.</p>
<h2>If you believe you don't owe the money</h2>
<p>You can apply to the court to set aside the judgment.</p>
<p>To get a judgment set aside, fill in the application notice (N244) and send it to the court.</p>
<p>You may have to pay a court fee of £255.</p>
<p>You’ll have to go to a private hearing at the court to explain why you do not owe the money.</p>
<p>If you do not go to the hearing, your application will be rejected and you’ll have to pay the amount in the judgment.</p>
