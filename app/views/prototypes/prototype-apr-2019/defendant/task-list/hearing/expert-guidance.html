        <h1 class="heading-large">Using an expert in small claims</h1>
        <p>It's rare for judges to allow you to use an expert in a small claim.</p>

        <p>You must ask for permission to use an expert - a judge will then decide whether the expert is necessary.</p>

        <p>The judge will also decide whether the cost of the expert is reasonable compared to the value of the claim.

        <p>Even though you and the {% if data['party'] == 'defendant' %}claimant{% else %}defendant{% endif %} share the cost of hiring the expert, judges are still responsible for keeping costs in proportion to value.</p>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">When an expert is allowed</h2>
        <p>A judge will only allow you to use an expert if they believe they need the expert's specialist knowledge to rule on the claim.</p>
        <p>For example, they might allow a structural engineer to be used in a claim about building works or a mechanic in a claim about car repairs.</p>
        <p>If a judge allows you to use an expert, you'll usually have to share one expert with the {% if data['party'] == 'defendant' %}claimant{% else %}defendant{% endif %}.</p>
        <p>The expert will provide a written report - they won't come to court in person.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Paying for the expert</h2>
        <p>The cost of hiring an expert depends on which expert you and the {% if data['party'] == 'defendant' %}claimant{% else %}defendant{% endif %} choose.

        <p>You both share this cost.</p>

        <p>If you win the case you may be able to recover a maxiumum of £750 of the cost you paid. A judge will rule on this at the end of the hearing.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">If you get permission to use an expert</h2>

        <p>First, you and {% if data['party'] == 'defendant' %}the claimant{% else %}the defendant{% endif %} need to follow these steps:</p>

        <ol class="list list-number">
          <li>Make a list of 3 independent experts who can provide a written report in return for a fee.</li>
          <li>Avoid discussing the case in detail with the 3 experts.</li>
          <li>Tell the court the names and costs of the 3 experts.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>{% if data['party'] == 'defendant' %}You then pick{% else %}The defendant then picks{% endif %} one expert from the list. After that, both of you need to follow these steps:</p>

        <ol class="list list-number">
          <li>Provide questions for the expert to answer in a report.</li>
          <li>Pay the expert, sharing the cost equally.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Finally, {% if data['party'] == 'defendant' %}the claimant needs{% else %}you need{% endif %} to:</p>
          <ol class="list list-number">
            <li>Upload the expert's report.</li>
            <li>Send the expert any questions either of you have about the report.</li>
            <li>Upload the expert's response.</li>
      </ol>
