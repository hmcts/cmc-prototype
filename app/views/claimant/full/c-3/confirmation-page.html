   <h2 class="heading-medium">What happens next</h2>
   <p>Mary Richards must respond to your claim by <span id="Date"></span>.
    <p>You’ll get an update if they respond. The court will email you to explain what to do if they don't respond.</p>
    <p> You can view the claim at any time on <a href='../../../dashboard/home?dashboard=1.2'>your money claims account</a>. </p>  
    <h2 class="heading-medium">What to do if you get paid</h2 >
      <p>Tell the defendant when you’ve received their payment.</p>
      <p>You must also tell the court what date you were paid or made an offer you’re happy with. Do this by updating your claim on <a href='../../../dashboard/home?dashboard=1.2'>your money claims account</a>.</p> 
      <h2 class="heading-medium"> If you disagree with the response</h2>
        You might have to go to a court hearing if:
        
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>the defendant says they don’t owe you any money</li>
          <li>they disagree with the amount you’ve claimed</li>
          <li>you don’t agree with how they’ve offered to repay you</li>
        </uL>
        <p>The court may send you a questionnaire asking for more information on the case.</p>
        <h2 class="heading-medium">What you can do</h2>
        <p>You can still contact Mary Richards directly while your claim progresses. Many people are able to settle their
          claim by discussing what's gone wrong. If you can make an agreement you won't need to go to a hearing.</p>
