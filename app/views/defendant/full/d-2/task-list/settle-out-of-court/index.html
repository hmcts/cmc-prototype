      <p>You can try to settle the claim by making the claimant an offer. If the claimant rejects your offer you’ll have to go a hearing. The claimant can’t mention that you made them an offer at the hearing.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-medium">Mediate</h3>

      <p>You can ask for mediation to settle the claim. If the claimant agrees to use the mediation service, you could settle the claim without going to court.</p>
