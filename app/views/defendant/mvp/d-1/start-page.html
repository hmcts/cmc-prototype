          Respond to a  money claim
        </h1>

        <p>You need to respond to the money claim within 14 days of receiving the claim.</p>

        <p>Your response will be sent to the claimant (the person or organisation who says you owe them money). The claimant can apply for a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/county-court-judgments-ccj-for-debt">County Court Judgment (CCJ)</a> against you if you don't respond in time. They can then use this to get the money from you. For example, they could hire bailiffs.</p>

        <p>A CCJ may make it harder to get credit, such as a mobile phone contract, credit card or mortgage.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-small">Accept the money claim</h3>

        <p>If you accept the claim is fair you can contact the claimant yourself and pay the money. Ask them to let the court know when they have your payment.</p>

        <p>If you can't afford to pay it all at once you can suggest a <a href="https://hmcts-cmc-prototype.herokuapp.com/prototype-18/owe-all/payment-options?radio-input-group=Cannot-afford">repayment plan</a> for them to consider.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-small">Reject the claim</h3>

      </p>If you don't accept you owe the amount of money claimed you can prepare and submit your defence online. You might have to go to a hearing - it can take up to 7 months to get a hearing date.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">Make a deal</h3>

      <p>You can try to settle the claim by making the claimant an offer. If the claimant rejects your offer you’ll have to go a hearing. The claimant can’t mention that you made them an offer at the hearing.</p>

      <h3 class="heading-small">If you think you’re owed money</h3>
      <p>If you believe the claimant owes you money you can make a claim against them (‘counterclaim’). Download and fill in <a href="http://hmctsformfinder.justice.gov.uk/HMCTS/GetForm.do?court_forms_id=659">Defence and Counterclaim form N9B</a>.
        <p>You might have to pay a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money/court-fees">court fee</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-small">If you can't afford to pay the money back</h3>
        <p>You might be able to get free legal advice to help you deal with debt from organisations like <a href="https://www.stepchange.org/">StepChange</a>.</p>
