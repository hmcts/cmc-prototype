          <p>This is a legal agreement. It is based on the information you and Jan Clark have given. It has not been reviewed by the court. 
          
          <h2 class="heading-medium" >What happens when you sign</h2>
          <p>If both parties sign the agreement then you're settling out of court. The money claim made by Jan Clark on 8 August will be put on hold.</p>
          <p>The money claim will be cancelled on 11 October 2017 if we don't hear from you or Jan Clark before then.</p>
          <h2 class="heading-medium">If you break the agreement</h2>
          <p class="">If you break the agreement Jan Clark can ask the court to either:</p>
          <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li class="">make a judgment against you for any money still owed under this agreement</li>
            <li class="">restart the original claim for the full amount and arrange a hearing</li>
