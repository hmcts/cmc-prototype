          <p>You can make a legal agreement to settle out of court. It's based on the information you and {% if data['defendant'] == "defendant" %}Jan Clark{% else %}Mary Richards {% endif %} have provided. It has not been reviewed by the court.</p>
          <h2 class="heading-medium" >What happens when you sign</h2>
          <p>If you and Jan Clark sign this agreement the court claim is put on hold. The claim will be cancelled on 11 October 2017 if the court doesn't hear from either of you.</p>

          <p>Once signed the agreement is confidential. You must not tell anyone about what's in it.</p>
