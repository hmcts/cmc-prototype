        Free mediation
      </h1>

      <p class="lede">You might feel you need to go to a hearing now. However, many people resolve their dispute before
        a hearing by taking part in telephone mediation.</p>

      <p>A mediator will:</p>
      <ul class="list list-bullet">
        <li>listen to each side separately - you won’t talk to directly to the other side</li>
        <li>ask you to consider what the other side says, but won’t make you compromise</li>
        <li>help you reach an agreement, if possible</li>
