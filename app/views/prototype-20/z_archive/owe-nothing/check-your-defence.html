        <p>The work on the roof was completed as per the contract.</p>
        <p>Jan says she contacted me but I didn't get a call or an email - I'd have been happy to take a look at the roof and see if there was a problem. There shouldn't be a need to get someone else in and the quote of £1,500 sounds high.

        I didn't get an email from Jan about this, so I didn't get a chance to sort it out. It would be good to see a copy of the email.

        We've worked in the roofing trade for 20+ years and have a really good reputation. We're members of the National Federation of Roofing Contractors and always pride ourselves on excellent customer service. We believe our work is of a high standard and we were not contacted by the customer about the problem to which this claim relates.
